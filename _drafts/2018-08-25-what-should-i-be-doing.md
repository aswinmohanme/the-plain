## What Should I Be Doing ?
Sometimes I wonder if I am not just winging through life, not achieving anything, not doing anything substantial.

I don't know what things I should be working on, what things would make a difference in the world. I don't even know if my work amounts to anything. I used to code like crazy in the days when I started to program for the first time. I didn't even checked if it would have any value
