## What should I be doing ?
Sometimes I wonder if I am not just winging through life, not achieving anything, not doing anything substantial.

I don't know what things I should be working on, what things would make a difference in the world. I don't even know if my work amounts to anything. I used to code like crazy in the days when I started to program for the first time. I didn't even checked if it would have any value or about the usability of  the code that I wrote. I programmed because I wanted to and there was no expectations. 

I think having a revenue generating side project which is moderately successful has increased the burden on me. Suddenly I feel like I'm growing up, I'm reluctant to learn new technologies and reluctant to work on things with no monetary value. I used to follow programming language tutorials, OS design projects and all, but now it's just will this make me money, if no then no.

I have lost the zest of side projects. I used to be consumed by them working for hours at a time. Now I'm easily distracted, and the most I can focus is for half an hour.

## What should I do now ?
These are my problems and honestly I don't know how to drag myself out of this rut. I have some ideas and I am going to try them one by one.

- Work on revenue generating side projects : Contray to what I think If I can learn a technology and use that to build something useful and that would generate revenue on the side it would be way easier on me to learn them.

- Do something like 12 Startup in 12 Months : Following such a program would help me put in the neccessary work in to finish projects.

- Create things : I'm consuming now more than I used to create. This might be the core reason, so that's  one way to tackle it.

## Closing thoughts
Side projects are fun and they keep me engaged and happy. I need to do more of them and not expect anything out of them.
