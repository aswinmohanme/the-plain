So I switched to Elementary OS 0.4 Loki after using Fedora for over an year, and this is how Elementary holded up.

> Spoiler: there is no ugly

Elementary is an Ubuntu based OS, that ships with it's own homegrown shell, and a couple of apps. It's entirely written in Vala, and strives to be a simple linux OS for beginners (coming from Windows or Mac) to pick it up. 

Elementary has it's own Indie App Store that can accept payments, and really gives a sh\*t about UI and UX. The latest version at the time of writing is Loki 0.4 that is based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

## The Good  
  
**Beautiful**     
Elementary is the most beautiful linux based OS I have ever used period (second to Mac OS, not Linux). And I'm a hard core configurator. I am a great fan of the design language of Apple and the extra care they put into each and every product, and elementary does a splendid job of recreating that feel with it's own twist. 

The end product is an OS that is pleasing to look at and gets out of your way. Each and everything is designed with absolute care and perfection. Although there are some quirks (it's just software) it's pretty solid in terms of look. 

Elementary is also not afraid to state it's beauty.

**Not Resource Hungry**  
The one thing that absoulely blew me away the first time I laid eyes on the resource monitor is how less system resource it uses. The Memory usage while I'm writing this is a mere 1.3 GB, that's with two firefox tabs open. That's impressive, but not stellar.

Overall the OS feels snappy and responsive, maybe that's an added benifit of writing your own shell. 

**Fonts**
This should have been under beauty, but the fonts on Elementary are crisp and really really beautiful. I have never seen such beautiful font rendering on stock OS. I once installed Infinality to see whether it would bring any improvement, but it actually made Elementary look bad.


## The Bad  
**Outdated Software**  
Ubuntu 16.04 is around 2 years old, so the ecosystem is
