So I switched to Elementary OS 0.4 Loki after using Fedora for over an year, and this is how Elementary holded up.

**So let's talk about Elementary**
Elementary OS is a Linux based distro (almost everything is one) that is based on Ubuntu. But rather that shipping with the default Unity that ships with Ubuntu 16.04, Elementary ships with `Pantheon Desktop` a homegrown shell written in Vala. 

Don't get me wrong Elementary is not a skin on top of Ubuntu, It's a whole ecosystem of beautifully designed apps and software that fits like cog wheels. Speaking of beauty Elementary is the most beautiful Linux based OS I have ever used (the best is Mac OS, not Linux).
